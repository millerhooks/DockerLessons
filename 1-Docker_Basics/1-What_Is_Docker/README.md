> Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Quote of
> features from Docker web pages:

>    Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code,>
>    runtime, system tools, system libraries ï¿½ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run
>    the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.[5]

> Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows
> and Linux.[6] Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces,
> and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others[7] to allow independent "containers" to run within a
> single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.[8]
